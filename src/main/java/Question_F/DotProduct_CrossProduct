#Question:
    What is dot product and cross product? Explain use cases of where dot product is used and cross product is used
    in graphics environment. Add links to places where you studied this information and get back with the
    understanding.

#ANS:
    In Vector , if we want add and subtract two vector its easy , but for the multiplication its little bit difficult.
    For the Multiplying two vector there is two way
    1> Scalar Product (Dot Product)
    2> Vector Product (Cross Product)

    1. Scalar Product(Dot Product)
    =>  If we want to multiply two vectors then we can use dot product. but in this case after multiplying we get quantity without
        direction , because of this  dot product called Scalar Product.
         Ex 1  A = [ai,bj,ck]
               B = [pi,qj,rk]
               A.B = ap+bq+cr
    Node:  if We don't need direction we can go for scalar product


    2. Vector Product(Cross Product)
    => if we want to multiply two vectors then we can use cross product, and with this we get the quantity with direction
       Ex 1  A = [ai,bj,ck]
             B = [pi,qj,rk]
             create Determinant of AxB
             AxB = |i,j,k|
                   |a,b,c|
                   |p,q,r|
             = [i(b*r-c*q)-j(a*r-c*p)+k(a*q-b*p)]

Note: if we want product with direction so Vector product uses
