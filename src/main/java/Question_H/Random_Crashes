#Question:
    Random crashes â€“ you are given a source code to test and it randomly crashes and it never crashes in the same

    about with isolating the cause.

#Ans:
    There is following reason for crashes

    3. External Library or Dependencies
    4. Threading

    Isolate the Causes
    1. logging (Print the log)
    2. Reproduce
    3. Code Review
    4. Testing
    5. Memory Space
    6. Collaboration
