#Question:
   The deeper you go into computer architecture and explain, better.

#Ans:
    The main Components of Computer is :
    1 C.P.U.
    2 Storage
    3 Input/OutPut

    1. C.P.U.
    => This is called brain of Computer because inside computer all operations done by the help of CPU, CPU stands for
       Central Processing units. it has three main components:
       a) A.L.U. (Arithmetic Logical unit)
       b) C.U. (Control unit)
       c) M.U. (Memory Unit)

       * A.L.U.
       => Performed all Mathematical or Arithmetical operation and logical Operation

       * C.U.
       => Manage the Instruction

       * M.U.
       => supply operands to the ALU and store the results of ALU operations.

    2. Storage
    =>  Stores data and instructions temporarily or permanently.
        There is two Types of Storage Device
        a) Primary Storage(Ram) -> It Store Data Temporary
        b) Secondary Storage(HDD/SDD) ->It Store Data Permanents

    3. Input/Output(I/O)
    => Facilitate communication between the computer and the user or other devices.
    Input Device->   1 Keyboard
                     2 Mouse
                     3 Touchpad
                     4 Webcams etc..

    Output Device->  1 Speaker
                     2 Monitor
                     3 Printer
                     4. Projector etc...
