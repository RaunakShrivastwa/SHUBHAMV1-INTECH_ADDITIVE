Question: Explain what is a greedy algorithm and how dynamic programming helps in this case.

Ans:
Greedy algorithm is a technique to finding optimal Solution, actually the main intention of greedy approach to finding locally
optimal choice at each stage to finding optimal solution. we choose minimum cost at each stage and choose optimal choice to getting more
profit.
but greedy approach does not gives always optimal solution.

In the case of the coin change problem, dynamic programming can be employed to find the minimum number of coins needed to make a
particular amount of change. By storing the solutions to subproblems and building up to the final
amount.
