#Ans:
    A few months ago, while designing an admin dashboard to manage website functions, I encountered the task of implementing
    pagination for displaying student records. Initially, it was quite challenging, and I spent considerable time trying
    various approaches to accomplish it. However, after several attempts and dedication, I successfully implemented the
    pagination feature. This accomplishment left me feeling immensely motivated, proud, and more confident in my abilities.
